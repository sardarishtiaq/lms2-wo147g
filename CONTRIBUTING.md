## Introduction

Welcome to the Multi-tenant CRM System project! This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to our enterprise-grade CRM solution. Our system is designed with strict tenant isolation in mind, making it crucial that all contributions maintain this security boundary.

### Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. All contributors must:
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

### Project Architecture

Our CRM system is built on a modern stack using:
- Node.js 18.x LTS for backend services
- React for frontend applications
- MongoDB for data storage
- Redis for caching
- Microservices architecture with strict tenant isolation

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js 18.x LTS
2. Configure local development environment
3. Set up required development tools:
   ```bash
   npm install -g eslint@^8.0.0 prettier@^2.8.0
   ```

### Repository Structure

```
├── backend/           # Backend services
├── frontend/          # React frontend application
├── infrastructure/    # Infrastructure as code
├── scripts/          # Development and deployment scripts
└── docs/             # Documentation
```

### Environment Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure required environment variables
3. Set up local development databases
4. Configure tenant isolation parameters

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

Format: `<type>/<scope>/<description>`

Types:
- `feature`: New feature development
- `bugfix`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix`: Critical production fixes
- `release`: Release preparation

Scopes:
- `backend`: Backend services
- `frontend`: Frontend application
- `infra`: Infrastructure changes
- `docs`: Documentation updates

Example: `feature/backend/add-lead-scoring`

### Commit Messages

Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test additions/modifications
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Maximum length: 72 characters

Example: `feat(leads): implement lead scoring algorithm`

### Pull Request Process

1. Create PR using the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`
2. Ensure all CI checks pass
3. Obtain minimum 2 approvals from code owners
4. Update documentation if API changes are involved
5. Maintain tenant isolation in all changes

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript Guidelines

```typescript
// Strict mode is required
"use strict";

// Interface naming
interface ILeadService {
  // ...
}

// Type naming
type TLeadStatus = "new" | "qualified" | "converted";

// Constants
const MAX_LEADS_PER_PAGE = 50;
```

Configuration:
- Max line length: 100 characters
- Strict TypeScript mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier enforced

### Documentation Requirements

- JSDoc comments for all public APIs
- README updates for new features
- API documentation for endpoints
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes

## Testing Requirements

### Coverage Thresholds

- Statements: 80%
- Branches: 80%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%

### Required Tests

1. Unit Tests
   - Business logic
   - Service layer
   - Utility functions

2. Integration Tests
   - API endpoints
   - Database operations
   - Tenant isolation

3. E2E Tests
   - Critical user flows
   - Multi-tenant scenarios

4. Performance Tests
   - Data operations
   - Tenant isolation overhead
   - API response times

## Security Guidelines

### Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Approved dependency list maintenance

### Code Scanning

1. Automated Scanning
   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency scanning
   - Secret detection

2. Manual Review Focus
   - Authentication logic
   - Tenant isolation
   - Data access patterns

### Vulnerability Reporting

Process: GitHub Security Advisories

Response times:
- Critical: Immediate
- High: 24 hours
- Medium: 48 hours
- Low: 1 week

### Multi-tenant Security Considerations

1. Data Isolation
   - Strict tenant context validation
   - No cross-tenant data access
   - Tenant-specific encryption keys

2. Access Control
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Tenant-specific permissions
   - Audit logging

## Questions and Support

For questions or support:
1. Check existing documentation
2. Search closed issues
3. Open a new issue with appropriate labels
4. Contact the core team for security concerns
